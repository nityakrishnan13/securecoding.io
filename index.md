
# Hi There!

I'm a Computer Engineering Master's student currently pursuing my first year at University of Delaware.
This page is dedicated to represent my interest and achievements as a secure software developer.

# The Journey

My interest in secure programming started with the Secure Software Design course that I took in my first semester.
The course took me through a life cycle starting from being a novice programmer to not just evolving as a better coder but a coder who puts security into perspective.
This was done through a series of team projects that required us to apply and bear in mind, coding standards from SEI CERT C Coding Standard and/or CERT C++.

The process of coding with these standards in mind required us to adopt the role of the blue team.
Code bases were later exchanged between teams to now role play as the red team, that would hunt for exploits and weaknesses in the opponent team's code.

# Skills Acquired

* The first team project that we worked on was the Markov Sentence Generator. Basically generation of a random tweet from a sample text file.
This project gave me ample opportunity to grasp C/C++ concepts like File Handling, Maps and Hash functions.

* The second project that we worked on was a Polynomial Addition Program where we computed the sum of an N degree polynomial.
We worked on incorporating Memory and String related coding standards.

* A command line version of Minesweeper was the next in line, where the user could input specific height, width and number of bombs to play the traditional game.
We took into consideration  Arrays, Expressions, declarations, initialization and other Miscellaneous standards for the red and blue team roles.

* Our final project was called Gee Mail.A secure messaging platform that allowed the registration/login of authenticated users and enabled them to read and send messages to users within the application.
This challenging task gave us our first insight into encryption. The task required us to create a database for the users and their messages.
