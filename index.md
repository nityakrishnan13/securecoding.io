
# Hi There!

I'm a Computer Engineering Master's student currently pursuing my first year at University of Delaware.
This page is dedicated to represent my interest and achievements as a secure software developer.

# The Journey

My interest in secure programming started with the Secure Software Design course that I took in my first semester.
The course took me through a life cycle starting from being a novice programmer to not just evolving as a better coder but a coder who puts security into perspective.
This was done through a series of team projects that required us to apply and bear in mind, coding standards from SEI CERT C Coding Standard and/or CERT C++.

The second security course that I took was the Web App Security class where I learned a bunch of different web app skills through creating four different projects.

Both these classes involved exchanging code bases with other teams so that we could play the roles of red team or blue team. The former for looking for security loopholes in the opposing teammates code and the latter for writing secure code.

# Skills Acquired
